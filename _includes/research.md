My research is about computational generation of narratives. Specifically, I am interested in the beliefs of story characters, how they acquire those beliefs, act on them and how that is conveyed to an audience. For example, in [The Lord of the Rings](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), the protagonist, Frodo, is to meet Gandalf at an inn, but Gandalf is not there. Before arriving, Frodo's belief was that Gandalf would be there, and he acted on that belief by going to the inn, but upon learning that Gandalf seems to have disappeared, he has to form a new plan. In the movie, he sees a dark, hooded figure in a corner, and forms a belief that that person is an enemy. This is conveyed to the audience by some cinematographic efforts (like lighting), but also in-world by Frodo inquiring about the hooded figure with the innkeeper, who tells him that the hooded figure is dangerous. Later this character is of course revealed as Aragorn, and Frodo has to revise his belief state again to account for the fact that they are allies. Many more examples like this can be found in other narratives, because conveying the internal beliefs of characters is often a key point in the narrative.

One genre in which character belief, knowledge acquisition and how these are conveyed to the audience is particularly interesting is that of Holmesian detective stories. The prototypical detective story starts by the detective being informed of some crime, and them then working to find the perpetrator. Basically, the detective (and the audience) is presented with the state of the world after the crime has been committed, and then has to figure out the chain of events that lead to that state. To do this, the detective has to plan how to acquire the clues necessary to apprehend the perpetrator. However, the perpetrator wants the detective not to find them. And more importantly, the author wants the detective to find the perpetrator, but not too quickly. My research deals with how these three requirements can be fulfilled simultaneously to generate a satisfying detective story.

To represent stories and be able to reason about them, I have developed the logical language [Impulse](https://liquidnarrative.csc.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2016/02/eger_impulse2015.pdf), which can represent actions and events that happened in a story, has a rich representation of time, based on Interval Temporal Logic, and also has a representation for character beliefs, desires and intentions.
