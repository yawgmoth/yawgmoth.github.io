One of my non-programming hobbies is experimenting in the kitchen, and one food item I miss from Austria is decent bread. Therefore, I have started to make my own bread, based on recipes from 
Austria. Since the bread turned out well, I typeset the recipe in LaTeX so that more people can enjoy it. You can download this recipe [here](/images/recipe.pdf).
