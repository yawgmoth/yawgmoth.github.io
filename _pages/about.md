I am currently a PhD student at [NC State University]{https://www.ncsu.edu/} under Dr. Michael Young in the [Liquid Narrative Group]{https://liquidnarrative.csc.ncsu.edu/}. My research interest is the computational generation of narrative. In particular, I am interested in how to model knowledge acquisition done by characters in a narrative, and how to convey that knowledge acquisition process to an audience. As a concrete application of this problem, I am looking at the generation of detective stories, where a detective character has to gather enough evidence to apprehend a criminal, while the audience is also told what the detective will find.


Before I was at NC State I got a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Computer Science from [TU Graz]{http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz} in Graz, Austria. For my bachelor's project I implemented an AI module based on behavior trees for the (now defunct) [RoboCup Middle Size League]{http://wiki.robocup.org/wiki/Middle_Size_League} team *Mostly Harmless*. 
My master's thesis was an extension of Shape Grammars to handle connections between parts of the generated shapes. This extension is basically like going from context-free to context-sensitive grammars for formal languages. However, in order to cut down on computational cost and to prevent unintended side-effects of context-sensitive rules, in my work these rules can be defined locally for a sub-part of the grammar. To demonstrate the capabilities of this language I also wrote a grammar that can produce variations of the design of the Eiffel Tower, down to individual rivets. 


When I am not doing research, I like playing video and board games, but also making my own. A particular pet interest of mine lies with the creation of AIs for digital implementations of board games. Some examples of my work in this area can be found on my [project page]{/projects/}.
