I am currently a PhD student at NC State University under Dr. Michael Young. My research interest is the computational generation of narrative. In particular, I am interested in how to model knowledge acquisition done by characters in a narrative, and how to convey that knowledge acquisition process to an audience. As a concrete application of this problem, I am looking at the generation of detective stories, where a detective character has to gather enough evidence to apprehend a criminal, while the audience is also told what the detective will find.


When I am not doing research, I like playing video and board games, but also making my own. A particular pet interest of mine lies with the creation of AIs for digital implementations of board games. Some examples of my work in this area can be found on my [project page]{/projects/}.
